# Aspen

This project is to identify enrollment figures for used when submitting data to apply for a grant program called the Aspen Frontier Set program. We don't have all the information necessary (like who transferred to a four year institution), so Joan Roadenberry gives us data regarding our students in a file called "ASPN<year>" This project includes a data flow task to import the data from that file into the database and a C# script to process the data therein.
